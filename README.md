//.hey, i'm john large aka bloom, the founder of studiobloom! i live at the intersection of art and technology, an exploration that began in childhood with late-night ms paint drawings and painstakingly crafted animations in powerpoint or windows movie maker. these childhood explorations laid the foundation for my career in digital design and development. it’s a curiosity that’s guided me towards a life in digital design and development, where i'm always creating something new, pushing the envelope, and blurring the boundaries between real and virtual.

//.my relationship with adobe creative suite began in middle school. over the years, photoshop, illustrator, and after effects have become the extensions of my creative mind. during high school my interest evolved toward web design, and i started crafting lots y2k-inspired websites, blending my graphic design skills with interactive elements.

//.as my journey continued, i embraced the world of 3d and game development, and i've spent the past five years honing those talents. with a versatile coding knowledge that spans javascript, python, c#, and c++, i've found joy in both freelance and passion projects.

//.nowadays, my time is well-invested in my career and my network. i have a robust circle of peers and friends across various fields, an extension of my abilities. together, we tackle large or complex projects. with their support, i can confidently take on projects of any scale, managing whatever comes our way, and ensuring we reach our goals.

//.so that's me - bloom - ever exploring, ever creating, and ready to take on the next digital frontier.
